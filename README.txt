Modern Dictionary Project(Diploma Final Year Project): 
Link: https://github.com/Vihitk05/ModernDictionary
This project was done by me and along with 4 more people. The project is a Dictionary which provides meaning, example, antonyms and synonyms for each and every word. The data is scraped and then pushed into our website. This also has a text to speech feature to improve our pronunciation and also a mic feature to search a word. We have also included some games to increase our vocabulary with fun and also download the dictionaries from the website and some blogs to read. And we also have 24/7 chatbot.
In this, my responsibilities were to handle the entire backend and to look for bugs in the website design and to create one of the games and blogs. 

Technologies used: Python, Django, HTML, Materialize CSS, JavaScript
